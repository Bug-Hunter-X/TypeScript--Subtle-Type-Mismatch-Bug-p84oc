This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in TypeScript related to type mismatches.  The `bug.ts` file contains code that appears to be correctly typed but can still throw runtime errors in JavaScript due to a mismatch between the expected and actual object structure. The `bugSolution.ts` file shows how to handle this issue using optional properties or type assertions.
